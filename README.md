# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 challenges in Haskell (because
it's nice to have a challenge).

Run these with stack using the following syntax:

    stack run <c> <f>

Where:

* `<c>` is the challenge, so for day 1, part 1 write `1.1`
* `<f>` is the input file path, e.g. `./src/day1_input.txt`

Run the unit tests using `stack test`.
